# **C++ Project Template**
A simple project template for quickly writing and compiling a C++ project. Uses a Zlib license by default but can be changed. My name is included in the license by default, so make sure you change it!
## **Build this project**
**1.** Open a terminal window in the root directory of this project.
**2.** Install the required packages.
```bash
$ sudo apt install g++ cmake
```
**3.** Create and enter the `build` directory.
```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
```
**4.** Generate CMake build files.
```bash
$ cmake ..
```
**5.** Build the project.
```bash
$ make
```
**6.** Run the generated executable.
```bash
$ ./test
```
